## **The Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Project**

### **A Data-Driven Approach to Transforming Water Access, Quality, and Equity in Maji Ndogo**

The Maji Ndogo Project utilizes **SQL and data analytics** to uncover the root causes of the water crisis in the Maji Ndogo region. By analyzing a rich, simulated dataset that mirrors real-world challenges, the project identifies critical issues—from **water accessibility** and **infrastructure failures** to potential **corruption patterns**—and proposes actionable, sustainable solutions.

This initiative is directly aligned with **UN Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**.

## **Project Goals**

Our data-driven analysis aims to achieve the following:

* **Quality & Safety:** Assess the quality and safety of different water sources.  
* **Equity:** Analyze water accessibility and distribution inequalities across the region.  
* **Infrastructure:** Detect critical infrastructure failures and primary sources of contamination.  
* **Governance:** Identify potential fraud or corruption in water service delivery.  
* **Intervention:** Recommend targeted interventions to improve water management and public safety.

 

## **Major Water Sources in Maji Ndogo**

Understanding the sources is key to solving the crisis.

| Source | Description | Safety Profile |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1 River** | Open water source. | **Least Safe:** Very high risk of biological and chemical contamination. |
| **2 Well** | Closed community water source. | **Unstable:** Safer than rivers but often contaminated due to aging systems and historical corruption. |
| **3 Shared Tap** | Publicly shared access point. | **Operational Challenges:** Common issues include long queue times and maintenance delays. |
| **4 Tap in Home** | Functional taps installed inside homes. | **Ideal Access:** Usually serves $\\approx$ 6 people per household. |
| **5 Broken Tap in Home** | Non-functional taps in homes. | **Infrastructure Failure:** Caused by pipe bursts, pump failures, or broken treatment systems. |

**Note on Household Data:** Records for in-home taps combine multiple homes. For example, the record **AkHa00000224** represents $\\approx$ 956 people (approximately 160 households).

 **Technologies & Methodology**

* **SQL (MySQL/SQL-style queries):** Core technology for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.  
* **Data Analysis & Cleaning:** Expertise in handling relational database concepts.  
* **Python:** Used for advanced data visualization and reporting.

##  **Project Structure**

The project is divided into four progressive parts, building a complete narrative from raw data to a comprehensive action plan.

### **Part 1 — Beginning the Data Journey: Foundation & Quality**

* Explore and understand the database structure.  
* Investigate water source quality and identify pollution issues.  
* Detect data inconsistencies and request an audit for integrity verification.

### **Part 2 — Clustering Data to Reveal the Water Crisis: Workers & Access**

* Clean and standardize workers’ information; investigate employee activity and performance.  
* Analyze: **Most/Non-functioning water sources**, **Unsafe water percentages**, and **Water accessibility** per town/province.  
* **Key Output:** Produce a **Water Accessibility and Infrastructure Summary Report**.

### **Part 3 — Weaving Maji Ndogo’s Narrative: Misconduct & Fraud**

* Analyze findings from the auditor report.  
* Detect employee misconduct, corruption, and discrepancies.  
* Uncover fraudulent patterns within service records to ensure resource accountability.

### **Part 4 — Charting the Course for Maji Ndogo’s Water Future: Solutions & Action**

* Assess distribution inequalities across towns and provinces.  
* Summarize all insights and findings into a coherent narrative.  
* **Key Output:** Initiate an **Action Plan for Water Accessibility and Safety Improvements**.

## **Key Outputs**

Upon completion, the project delivers:

* Comprehensive **Water Quality Assessments**.  
* **Infrastructure Improvement Recommendations** based on failure patterns.  
* **Fraud Detection Insights** and accountability measures.  
* Detailed **Province & Town-Level Water Access Reports**.

Access to **safe water is a fundamental human right**.

By applying data analytics in the same way real governments, NGOs, and utility companies operate, this project demonstrates how **data-driven decisions** can directly lead to tangible improvements in **public health, infrastructure development, and the overall quality of life** for millions.
